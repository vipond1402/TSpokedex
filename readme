To run the code examples that I have provided, you will need to have the following tools installed on your computer:

Node.js: Node.js is a JavaScript runtime that allows you to run JavaScript code outside of a web browser. You can download and install Node.js from https://nodejs.org/.
npm: npm is the package manager for Node.js, and is included with the Node.js installation. It allows you to install and manage the third-party libraries and dependencies that your code requires.
Create React App: Create React App is a tool that makes it easy to create and build React applications. You can install Create React App using the following command:
Copy code
npm install -g create-react-app
Once you have these tools installed, you can use the following steps to run the code examples:

Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you want to save the code.
Create a new React app using Create React App. For example, to create an app named my-app, you can use the following command:
Copy code
create-react-app my-app
This will create a new directory named my-app with the initial files and structure for a React app. Navigate to this directory using the following command:
Copy code
cd my-app
Install the third-party libraries and dependencies that the code examples require. For example, to install the Axios library, you can use the following command:
Copy code
npm install axios
Replace the existing code in the src/App.tsx file with the code examples that I provided.
Start the development server for the app using the following command:
Copy code
npm start
This will start a local development server that you can use to test and run the code examples. The server will automatically open a new tab in your web
